# quickReports  
A quick report system for marine data

Streamlined analyses of fieldwork data for early alert needs at the Marine terminal

###Objective:

To develop a pipeline of basic analyses and reporting to describe the general properties of the marine community around
the marine terminal of PeruLNG 

###hat Protocols?

Fish Protocol to start
Benthos Protocol will depend on availability of results from sample analysis

###What do we need for that?

- Dataset in EXCEL format, curated, and ready to export to CSV
- How it should be organized?
 
###What do we want to report?

1. Basic metrics and changes over time if pertinent (e.g. Abundance, Biomass, Richness)
2. Diversity indexes (e.g. Shannon -but doesn't take into account rare species-)
2. CPUE Estimates (if dataset is already available)
3. Community structure (By type of bottom -hard/soft- or depth?)
5. Annotated Lists of species
6. Charts and tables

###How to report?

The pipeline will be developed using a combination of scripts in R and probably Python. 
A GUI front end is an alternative for later, but not necessary for the purpose of reporting
